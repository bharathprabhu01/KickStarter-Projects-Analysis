# KickStarter-Projects-Analysis

An Explorartory Data Analysis project where a team consisting of myself and a partner obtained insights on KickStarter Projects from April 2009 to January 2018 to explore the following questions:

1. Which main/sub categories might tend to have the greatest success?

2. Does the goal amount of a project have any association with its success?

3. Does Launch Date and Time Duration of a project have any association with its success?

4. Which country has the highest success rate of projects?
